Hot Tub Party was founded with the mission of inspiring others to explore and preserve the incredible national parks found throughout the United States. The founders of Hot Tub Party are nature enthusiasts who have been visiting the national parks for as long as they can remember. They are hikers, campers, climbers, and of course road trippers.

It's our goal to become the leading resource for information regarding national parks. From the best parks to visit, to the ideal season, and even the top trails, we are excited to provide you with all of the information you'll need while visiting a national park.
