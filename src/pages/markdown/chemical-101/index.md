So you bought a hot tub spa?! Awesome! We want to share some tips with you that can guarantee you’ll have your spa in tip-top shape for many years to come. Just take our advice on what to add during startup and routine maintenance and it will keep your hot tub spa running great, the water looking clear, and YOU feeling relaxed knowing you are taking good care of your hot tub spa. 



Disclaimer: the information in this article is specific to Master Spas hot tubs with the EcoPur Mineral filtration system that strips out the chlorine after 4-6 hours, although much of the information can be used in the maintenance of other hot tub models. 



Notes: For exact amounts of the chemicals please follow the directions on the bottle. 


## Before You Empty
If you’ve had your tub for a while and you’re ready to “start fresh,” before you drain the water you’ll need to add a **Spa and Tub Flush** to get the behind-the-pipes gunk and blockages that can build up over time. Important: take out your filters, add the Spa and Tub Flush to the water, and cycle for one hour with the pump on high. THEN drain or pump out the water. 

## Water + Start-Up Chemical Kit
You’ll be filling up your hot tub spa from the garden hose, but be sure to let the water run clear before adding the hose to your hot tub; sitting water is a breeding ground for unwanted guests, and we want a nice clean start. 

During the initial filling of the hot tub spa add the following to the water and let circulate for at least 30 minutes: 
- Metal Protect
- Scale Defense
- Oil Gone
- Phos Gone

## Testing the Water
Use your **Test Strips** and test for pH, total alkalinity, and calcium hardness. 

Check safe ranges below:
- pH safe zone: 7.2 - 7.6
- Total alkalinity safe zone: 80 - 120 ppm
- Calcium hardness safe zone: 200 - 400 ppm

## Level Up (or Down)
Depending on what your test strips read, you may need to make a few additions of different chemicals to balance it out. 

This is the order in which you should balance: 
- 1st: Balance Alkalinity
- 2nd: Balance pH
- 3rd: Balance Calcium Hardness

Balance Alkalinity
Adjust DOWN the Alkalinity (and pH) by adding **pH / Alkalinity Down**
Adjust UP the Alkalinity by adding **Alkalinity Up**

Balance pH
Adjust DOWN the pH (and Alkalinity) by adding **pH / Alkalinity Down**
Adjust UP the pH by adding **pH Up**

Balance Calcium Hardness
Adjusting DOWN the hardness is not necessary, you will always adjust it up
Adjust UP the hardness by adding **Spa Hardness UP**

## Sanitize
Add 2 oz of **Chlorinating Granules** (Dichlor) to reach a free chlorine level of 8 ppm for sanitizing. Let the spa circulate. Do not enter the spa until levels have dropped below 5 ppm. The EcoPur mineral filter will filter out all chlorine in 4-6 hours and your test strips should read zero (that’s a good thing!).

## Troubleshoot
Test your spa water again with your handy dandy test strips. Everything might be right on target. However, if your free chlorine reads below total chlorine, add **Oxidizer Shock.**

## Maintenance
- After Use: when you are done using the spa for the day, add ½ oz of Chlorine Granules (Dichlor) to the spa.
- Once a week: add Oxidizer Shock.
- Every 6 months: we recommend a drain and refill. 

And there you have it! Hot tub spa maintenance is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. And we’re here to help you along the way.
